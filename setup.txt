Setup and Running Instructions:

1. Unzip the provided folder into a convenient location on your computer.
2. Inside the unzipped folder, double-click the run_app file. This will initiate the setup and start the application.
Please note: The very first run can take approximately 5â€“10 minutes as the environment sets up. If the process stops or closes prematurely, simply double-click run_app again to continue.
3. Once fully set up, a web browser window will open automatically, displaying the Mentor-Mentee Matching Tool.

Stopping the Application:

To stop the application, return to the terminal or command prompt window that opened automatically when you ran run_app, and press CTRL + C. After that, you may close the browser window.

Subsequent Runs:

Subsequent runs of the tool will be significantly faster, typically launching within a few seconds.
